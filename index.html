    <h2>Re-watch</h2>
    <p>Have you ever seen a movie for the first time that seemed so incredibly hard to understand that you've had to go watch a youtube video explaining it? Well, if you are going to watch a video explaining it, then you must have liked it enough to re-watch it again. Re-watching is a great way to understand and soak up meaning in films. Take the movie Interstellar for example, being a Christopher Nolan film, it is usually intended to be brilliantly confusing. Re-watching gives you a second chance to take each bit in, knowing what happens at the end. There will be little drops of paralells or information that could lead to the end results of the movie, finding these out can give us a better understanding of what was going on and more appreciation for the amazing minds who had put the movie together.</p>         
        <h2>My Favourite films</h2>
        <p>I have 4 favourite films that I know anyone who decides to watch will enjoy. My absolute favourite movie is Arrival. Arrival - Directed by Denis Villeneuve, is a dramatic sci-fi that takes place when 12 alien spaceships land across the world. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is called in to dissect the aliens language in order to unravel the mystery of why they are there. There are many reasons to love this film, my favourite is the score. The music - done by Jóhann Jóhannsson truly converts feelings from the film through the screen and into our minds. Another aspect of this film that I love is the visuals, each shot is gorgeous and makes watching very enjoyable.</p>
        <p>Dune part 2 - again directed by Denis Villeneuve is a book adaptation based years in the future. This sci-fi film is exciting, beautiful and timeless. The film surrounds a young man named Paul Atreides who form together with the natural habitants of Arrakis to seek revenge against the conspirators who killed his family. While doing so he must prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. Dune part 2, being IMDb's highest rated film in history proves that this is a must watch. The gorgeous scenes, the sound design, the acting etc. Everything about this movie is amazing.</p>
        <p>Sound of Metal - Directed by Darius Marder is a music drama about a man named Ruben Stone (Riz Ahmed) who performs in a two person heavy metal band with his girlfriend. One day he begins to lose his hearing while playing a set. Then one day, it's gone. This film is about patience, acceptance and learning. I think that, although it doesn't sound as thrilling as the other two films I listed, the very simple storyline is still so impactful.</p>
        <p>The Banshees of Inisherin - Directed by Martin McDonagh is a quiet and simple film that has a quite a few funny moments that are worth the watch. Padric is devastated when his long time bestfriend Colm abruptly ends their friendship. Padric, being in disbelief, tries to mend his relationship determined to get his friend back. Against colms will, he will stop at nothing until one day Colm gives Padric an ultimatum that results in shocking consequences. The first time I watched this I really didn't hook on to it. I thought I should give it another go and I was not disappointed. The great Irish accents and slang add to the humour brilliantly, along with very likeable characters. This film is a great watch when feeling like a bit of a pick me up.</p>
